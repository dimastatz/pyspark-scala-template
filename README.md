# Apache Spark project template

## Background
In today's data-driven world, collaboration between data engineers and data scientists is critical for the success of any data project. Data engineers are responsible for designing and building the infrastructure required for data storage, processing, and transformation. Data scientists, on the other hand, are responsible for developing and deploying machine learning models and deriving insights from the data. To ensure productive collaboration between these two groups, there are some challenges to address: what are responsibilities of each group, how they communicate, how they establish quality standards, etc. And probably the most challenging questions is what common tools and frameworks can be used by data scientists and data engineers to develop, maintain and ship products?  


## Apache Spark
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a powerful open-source data processing framework that supports multiple programming languages, including Scala and Python. Combining these two languages in a single Spark project can be advantageous because it allows developers to leverage the strengths of both languages and their associated libraries. Another huge advantage of combining Scala and Python is to allow for two Data Science and Data engineering audiences working together.
